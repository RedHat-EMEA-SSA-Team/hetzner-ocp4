## How to install RHEL 9 and use it as Hetzner base image

### Download the image and install a RHEL-9-minimal virtual machine

Download the RHEL 9.1 DVD image from [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/479/ver=/rhel---9/9.1/x86_64/product-software)

Create a virtual machine and boot from the downloaded ISO. Once the `Anaconda Installer` is loaded, adjust settings as required. The recommended adjustments are `minimal` software selection and specific filesystem layout. For all other options, the defaults are sufficient.

Adjust the filesystem layout to be more compatible with automation of this repository.

Open the disk partitioning dialog and select `Manual Partitioning` and create the filesystem layout choosing the automation proposal and LVM.

Once created, change the volume group for `root` and `swap` logical volume to `vg0`

When finished, it will look like this.

Wait until the installation is finished and press reboot.

### Configure the system to match Hetzner requirements

Once installed and rebooted, login with previously given credentials and adjust accordingly to meet Hetzner requirements.

#### Install package dependencies and upgrade the OS to latest version

```shell
# dnf install -y lvm2 mdadm tar bzip2
# dnf upgrade 
```

#### Disable LVM system.devices

In RHEL 9, `system.devices` became [default](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/pdf/configuring_and_managing_logical_volumes/red_hat_enterprise_linux-9-configuring_and_managing_logical_volumes-en-us.pdf), which is not recommended for the image-based installation for Hetzner. Disable as such:

```shell
# rm -f /etc/lvm/devices/system.devices
# sed -i -E 's/\s+# use_devicesfile = 0/        use_devicesfile = 0/' /etc/lvm/lvm.conf
```

#### Enable autoassembly of special devices

To allow RAID and LVM devices scanned during boot, `rd.auto` needs to be enabled.

```shell
# grubby --update-kernel=/boot/vmlinuz-5.14.0-162.6.1.el9_1.x86_64 --args=rd.auto
```

#### Create a symlink for dracut

Hetzner creates a ram disk and uses the dracut tool. It expects dracut to be installed under `/sbin`. This is not the case since RHEL 8 so we will add a symlink.

```shell
# ln -s /usr/bin/dracut /sbin/dracut
```

#### Cleanup and finish image creation

Remove not required wireless firmware-drivers

```shell
# dnf remove iwl*
```

Unregister and remove cached files

```shell 
# subscription-manager unregister
# subscription-manager clean
# dnf clean all
# rm -rf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
```

Finally, clean the history

```shell
# history -c
```

Create the image-archive, which can be uploaded to the rescue-shell

```shell
# tar cJvf /CentOS-91-el-x86_64-minimal.tar.xz --exclude=/dev --exclude=/proc --exclude=/sys --exclude=/CentOS-91-el-x86_64-minimal.tar.xz /
```

## Install the image on your server

Boot the Hetzner system into the Rescue Shell, create `config.txt` and upload the image to your `/root` folder for use with the `installimage` tool.

Based on the volume group name chosen during the image creation, one needs to adjust the `PART lvm vg0` in the `config.txt` file. Below is the example, based on the image created above.

```txt
DRIVE1 /dev/sda
DRIVE2 /dev/sdb
DRIVE3 /dev/sdc
DRIVE4 /dev/sdd
 
SWRAID 1 
SWRAIDLEVEL 0 
BOOTLOADER grub 
HOSTNAME lab.froemer.net
PART /boot ext4 1024M 
PART lvm vg0 500G
PART lvm vg1 all

LV vg0 root            /               xfs  40G
LV vg0 swap            swap            swap 15G
LV vg0 home            /home           xfs  30G
LV vg0 tmp             /tmp            xfs   5G
LV vg0 var             /var            xfs  10G
LV vg0 libvirt /var/lib/libvirt/images xfs  all

LV vg1 storage /data xfs all

IMAGE /root/CentOS-91-el-x86_64-minimal.tar.xz
```

To install the image, run the `installimage` command.

```shell
# installimage -a -c config.txt
```

The output should look like the following:

```txt

                Hetzner Online GmbH - installimage

                  INSTALLATION COMPLETE
   You can now reboot and log in to your new system with the
 same credentials that you used to log into the rescue system.
```

That's it - perform a `reboot` and have fun.
